Getting Started
-----------------------

1. Pull the repo and run GenerateSolution.bat or edit the project name using the methods shown below
2. Run Engine/ThirdParty/GenerateSolutions.bat (Until I figure out a good way to remove this step)
3. Open the generated solution in the root folder
4. Build & Celebrate

Editing the project name
-----------------------

Edit the GenerateSolution.bat file and change the --project-name property with your desired name.
This is important since it will be used when searching for project files.

Replace the word MitchGame on the folders MitchGame and MitchGame_EntryPoint with the same name as the --project-name. EX TestGame and TestGame_EntryPoint
